### Overview

About Code Refactoring
Code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code without changing its external behavior. It is a crucial aspect of maintaining a healthy and sustainable codebase, allowing for improved readability, maintainability, and extensibility. Martin Fowler's book provides valuable insights and best practices for refactoring code effectively.


# Remember 
Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.
